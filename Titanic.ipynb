    "**RMS Titanic** was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking one of modern history's deadliest peacetime commercial marine disasters. RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, chief naval architect of the shipyard at the time, died in the disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis:\n",
    "As I remember from the movie titanic, after the crash, priority was given to females and children to fill the lifeboats however I assume that's the not only case. My main assumption for this research is that the passenger's class location had the biggest influence on the outcome if he or she survived. Higher the class closer the passenger would have been located to the deck, thus front row in the line for the lifeboats. Also, the actual fare passenger paid will not correlate with the chances of survival, hearsay the higher fare doesn't necessarily mean that passenger was in the better class."

    "The ship once proclaimed as 'unsinkable' bears one of the most profound tragedies. For the Kaggle challenge, we have the data of the passengers on the ship. Data is split into halves for the train-set and for test-set. Our goal is to build the model which will predict survivability of the passengers based on provided characteristics with the precision of > 80%. We have multiple columns, and our goal is to decide which variables to keep and which variables to drop.\n",

    "First, I need to address the elephant in the room. It's a bit weird that I got 100% precision on predicting survivability on the train-data. Maybe I made some technical mistake, however, it can also be attributed to the neat cleaning of the data and train-set being more explicit in terms of characteristics than the train set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, the results confirm the assumptions I made at the beginning of the project. Being female and being the passenger of the first-class massively increases the chances of surviving. Being under 10 years old also contributes to a positive outcome. However, paying higher fare doesn't necessarily mean the passenger ended in the first class, as this would have increased his or her survival chances. This can be attributed to the fact that some tickets were maybe sold in the aftermarket with higher rates. Or some tickets could have been more expansive in the different ports. For this project, I didn't go into details explaining how passengers embarking port influenced the outcome of placing him or her in a certain class or if the fare for the tickets significantly differed in those ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the model, logit regression was initially my first choice and it didn't disappoint so I didn't see the reason to try linear regression or classification. 80% succession rate on the train set can be assumed to be satisfactory, would I have gone figuring out the ages of the passengers, whose data was missing, instead of just filling them with average rate, could have increased the success rate. I was thinking of approximating age based on the title passenger name contained (for example, if it was Mrs. I bet she was more than 10. If no title maybe under 20 and so on).\n",
